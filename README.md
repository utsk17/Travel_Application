# native_features_app

A basic application where the user can add their specific locations via Google Maps to the application. Various external packages have been used for developing this application, so as the application can not only take user's locations's as inputs, but also has the ability to take a picture using camera of the emulator the device has been opened onto. 

Note-
The installation of google maps and using available API's is possible when the user has a google cloud account which is verified, upon verification a unique API key is generated to the user. Hence, the given code base's map feature will not be working if pulled into some other local device.
